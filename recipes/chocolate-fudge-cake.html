            <li>150ml sunflower oil, plus extra for the tin</li>
            <li>175g self-raising flour</li>
            <li>2 tbsp cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>

            <li>2 tbsp golden syrup</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>150ml semi-skimmed milk</li>
            <p><strong>For the icing</strong></p>
            <li>100g unsalted butter</li>
            <li>225g icing sugar</li>
            <li>40g cocoa powder</li>
            <li>2Â½ tbsp milk (a little more if needed)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
            <p>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Oil and line the base of two 18cm sandwich tins. Sieve the flour, cocoa powder and bicarbonate of soda into a bowl. Add the caster sugar and mix well.</p>
            <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
            <p>Make a well in the centre and add the golden syrup, eggs, sunflower oil and milk. Beat well with an electric whisk until smooth.</p>
            <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
            <p>Pour the mixture into the two tins and bake for 25-30 mins until risen and firm to the touch. Remove from oven, leave to cool for 10 mins before turning out onto a cooling rack.</p>
            <li><strong>Step 4</strong></li>
            <p>To make the icing, beat the unsalted butter in a bowl until soft. Gradually sieve and beat in the icing sugar and cocoa powder, then add enough of the milk to make the icing fluffy and spreadable.</p>
            <li><strong>Step 5</strong></li>
            <p>Sandwich the two cakes together with the butter icing and cover the sides and the top of the cake with more icing.</p>
